Important points from the rfc specific to servers :

1. A server SHOULD return 414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a URI is longer than the server can handle.
Note: Servers ought to be cautious about depending on URI lengths
      above 255 bytes, because some older client or proxy
      implementations might not properly support these lengths.
